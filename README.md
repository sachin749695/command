# FIRST GENERATION
--
___

>**The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. Therefore, they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it.**



1. **TIME PERIOD**: 1951-1959
1. **SIZE** : *VERY LARGE SYSYTEM*
1. **TECHNOLOGY**  : *VACUUM TUBES*
1. **PROCESSING** : *VERY SLOW*

# SECOND GENERATION

>**The period of second generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices**


1. **TIME PERIOD**: 1959-1963
1. **SIZE** : *SMALLER*
1. **TECHNOLOGY**  : *TRANSISTERS*
1. **PROCESSING** : *FASTER*

##**CHARACTERIZED BY**
